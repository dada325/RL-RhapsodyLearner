# RL-RhapsodyLearner
Rhapsody Learner is the framework of Deep Reinforcement learning 

This is for my research on the Algorithmic Aspects of Learning in Games, more specifically it is a learner which learn optimal strategies in complex, multi-agent environments where the other agents are also learning and adapting their strategies. 

But it is also an implementation of some algorithms in deep RL that is very classic, in JAX and pytorch.
